## Object Recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset! 🌟

### 🔍 Phase 1: Preprocessed the CIFAR-10 dataset to ensure high-quality inputs.
### 💻 Phase 2: Developed a neural network from scratch in Python without using any libraries.
### 🔧 Phase 3: Built an object detection model using TensorFlow and Keras.
### 🚀 Phase 4: Enhanced a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model with additional layers and trained it on CIFAR-10.
### Kaggle API for seamless dataset integration.
